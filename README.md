# Maze Game

This game was programmed to be played in fullscreen;
therefore, it must be played that way -- it is not a bug.

It is imperative that in the link you allow the web
browser to allow all audio, if you are on google chrome
you can do this by:
1. Clicking the lock icon in the left side of the search bar.
2. Selecting "Site Settings".
3. In permissions, scroll to "Sound" and select "Allow".
4. Then, refresh the page in order to update the permissions.

This game is centered around audio cues and sound so
it is vital that you take these steps before continuing.

Classes were utilized during this program in order to make the
program slightly neater and more readable, they were also very
helpful when initially programming it.

If you accidentally press escape instead of using the esc fullscreen
button, please press the esc fullscreen button and then press esc once
more. You may then go back into fullscreen; please stick to using only
the fullscreen button to traverse the fullscreen.
