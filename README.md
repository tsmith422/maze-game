# Maze Game

## Permissions
It is imperative that in the link you allow the web
browser to allow all audio.
### If you are on google chrome you can do this by:
1. Clicking the ```lock icon``` in the left side of the search bar.
2. Selecting ```Site Settings```.
3. In `permissions`, scroll to `Sound` and select `Allow`.
4. Then, refresh the page in order to update the permissions.

### On Firefox, you can enable this by:
1. Opening the ```application window``` in the top right.
2. Selecting `settings`.
3. Search in the ```Find in settings:``` `Autoplay`.
4. Click on ```autoplay settings``` and enable ```video and sound```.
5. Then, refresh the page in order to update the permissions.

This game is centered around audio cues and sound so
it is vital that you take these steps before continuing.

## Before you play
This game was programmed to be played in fullscreen;
therefore, it must be played that way -- it is not a bug.

Classes were utilized during this program in order to make the
program slightly neater and more readable, they were also very
helpful when initially programming it.

If you accidentally press escape instead of using the esc fullscreen
button, please press the esc fullscreen button and then press esc once
more. You may then go back into fullscreen; please stick to using only
the fullscreen button to traverse the fullscreen.

## Creator's Note
This project was made in my senior year of high school as my final project
for my University of Texas Computer Fluency course; I had never programmed or
created anything visual using javascript before. The project required the use of
sound, graphics, and some level of user interaction.

I was tasked with creating this project using the p5.js website: [p5.js](https://p5js.org/)
